# Qt Widget platformer Game

This project aims to develop reusable tools for cross-platform game development using the C++ language and the Qt framework, instead of writing scripts. It focuses on implementing essential components of a game engine that can be seamlessly integrated into a Qt/C++ project.

The project prioritizes the implementation of key components through a game example, ensuring that the code can be easily reused for future game development. Key components include:
-	Asset Management for handling game resources.
-	Animation system for managing character and object sprites and states.
-	Game Physics for handling kinematic, dynamic, and collision aspects.
-	Game Intelligence for NPC (non-player character) behavior featuring algorithms like pathfinding and path following (https://github.com/msmouni/path-finding).

External tools like "Tiled" (https://github.com/mapeditor/tiled) may be utilized for functions such as Level Editing.

Currently, this project is in its early stages.
